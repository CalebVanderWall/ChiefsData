# ChiefsData
This project investigates whether Taylor Swift’s attendance at Kansas City Chiefs games has a measurable causal impact on the team’s offensive performance. Using game-level data from the 2023–2024 NFL season, the analysis compares points scored when Swift attended versus when she did not, controlling for confounding factors through predictive modeling and causal inference methods. A LASSO regression was applied to select relevant features, and treatment effect estimators (ATE, ATT, ATU) were used to estimate Swift’s impact. The results suggest that while Swift’s presence generates significant cultural attention, her attendance is associated with only a marginal estimated increase of 0.175 points scored per game—a difference too small to meaningfully influence outcomes. These findings highlight both the limitations of observational causal inference with small sample sizes and the distinction between media narratives and statistically measurable effects.
