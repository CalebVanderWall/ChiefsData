    "text": "Data Description\nThe data I will be using consists of Kansas City Chiefs season performance statistics from Pro Football Reference spanning the 2013 to 2024 seasons. I am constraining the data to this time frame because 2013 marks the year Andy Reid was hired as head coach, ushering in a new era of consistent leadership and a distinct shift in the team’s playing style and strategic approach. This period provides a cohesive and relevant context for analyzing performance trends and causal impacts.\n\nData Dictionary\nYear – The year the game took place.\nWeek – The week of the NFL season in which the game was played.\nDay – The day of the week the game occurred.\nTime – The time of day the game started.\nOutcome – The result of the game (Win or Loss).\nOT – Indicates whether the game went into overtime.\nRec – The team’s win-loss record at the time of the game.\nLocation – Indicates whether it was a home or away game.\nOpp – The name of the opposing team.\nPtS – Points scored by the Chiefs.\nPtA – Points allowed (points scored by the opponent).\nFirstD – Number of first downs achieved by the Chiefs.\nTotYd – Total yards gained on offense.\nPassY – Total passing yards.\nRushY – Total rushing yards.\nTO – Number of turnovers committed by the Chiefs.\nFirstD_Alwd – First downs allowed to the opponent.\nTotYd_Alwd – Total yards allowed to the opponent.\nPassY_Alwd – Passing yards allowed.\nRushY_Alwd – Rushing yards allowed.\nTO_Alwd – Turnovers forced by the Chiefs’ defense.\nExOff – Expected offensive performance (expected points gained on offense).\nExDef – Expected defensive performance (average expected points prevented per play).\nExSpec – Expected special teams performance.\nTaylor_Attend – Indicates whether Taylor Swift attended the game (Yes/No).\n\nkcc_g_16 &lt;- read_csv(\"C:/Users/caleb/OneDrive/Desktop/School/Math 437/Final Project/Project Data/kcc_g_16.txt\", show_col_types = FALSE)\nkcc_g_24 &lt;- read_csv(\"C:/Users/caleb/OneDrive/Desktop/School/Math 437/Final Project/Project Data/kcc_g_24.txt\", show_col_types = FALSE)\nkcc_g_23 &lt;- read_csv(\"C:/Users/caleb/OneDrive/Desktop/School/Math 437/Final Project/Project Data/kcc_g_23.txt\", show_col_types = FALSE)\nkcc_g_22 &lt;- read_csv(\"C:/Users/caleb/OneDrive/Desktop/School/Math 437/Final Project/Project Data/kcc_g_22.txt\", show_col_types = FALSE)\nkcc_g_21 &lt;- read_csv(\"C:/Users/caleb/OneDrive/Desktop/School/Math 437/Final Project/Project Data/kcc_g_21.txt\", show_col_types = FALSE)\nkcc_g_20 &lt;- read_csv(\"C:/Users/caleb/OneDrive/Desktop/School/Math 437/Final Project/Project Data/kcc_g_20.txt\", show_col_types = FALSE)\nkcc_g_19 &lt;- read_csv(\"C:/Users/caleb/OneDrive/Desktop/School/Math 437/Final Project/Project Data/kcc_g_19.txt\", show_col_types = FALSE)\nkcc_g_18 &lt;- read_csv(\"C:/Users/caleb/OneDrive/Desktop/School/Math 437/Final Project/Project Data/kcc_g_18.txt\", show_col_types = FALSE)\nkcc_g_17 &lt;- read_csv(\"C:/Users/caleb/OneDrive/Desktop/School/Math 437/Final Project/Project Data/kcc_g_17.txt\", show_col_types = FALSE)\nkcc_g_16 &lt;- read_csv(\"C:/Users/caleb/OneDrive/Desktop/School/Math 437/Final Project/Project Data/kcc_g_16.txt\", show_col_types = FALSE)\nkcc_g_15 &lt;- read_csv(\"C:/Users/caleb/OneDrive/Desktop/School/Math 437/Final Project/Project Data/kcc_g_15.txt\", show_col_types = FALSE)\nkcc_g_14 &lt;- read_csv(\"C:/Users/caleb/OneDrive/Desktop/School/Math 437/Final Project/Project Data/kcc_g_14.txt\", show_col_types = FALSE)\nkcc_g_13 &lt;- read_csv(\"C:/Users/caleb/OneDrive/Desktop/School/Math 437/Final Project/Project Data/kcc_g_13.txt\", show_col_types = FALSE)\n\n\n\nData Limitations\nChoosing a response variable to measure offensive success is a critical first step. While several variables—such as Outcome, TotYd (total yards), and PtS (points scored)—could serve as indicators, each comes with trade-offs.\nOutcome (win/loss) is influenced heavily by defensive and special teams performance, making it a poor standalone measure of offensive success. TotYd isolates offensive effort more cleanly, but it fails to account for the ultimate goal of the offense: scoring points.\nPtS offers the most direct measure of offensive success, as it captures the end result of drives and includes field goals, which reflect moderate offensive effectiveness. While PtS does include occasional scores from defense and special teams (e.g., pick-sixes, safeties, return touchdowns), these are relatively rare and unlikely to significantly skew the analysis.\nIdeally, we would use a variable representing offensive-only points scored, but such a measure is not available in our data. Therefore, we will proceed with PtS (points scored) as our response variable, acknowledging its limitations.\nLastly, offensive output must be interpreted in the context of the opponent’s defensive strength—30 points against a weak defense is not equivalent to 14 against a top-tier one. While we lack a “predicted offensive output” metric to directly control for this, we recognize this limitation in our model’s interpretability."

While the exact definition of ExOff is unclear, it appears to reflect some measure of offensive performance. We hypothesize that ExOff represents the average expected points per offensive play in a game.\n\nggplot(kcc_g_test, aes(x = ExOff, y = PtS, color = Taylor_Attend)) +\n  geom_point(size = 4, alpha = 0.8) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"red\", \"gold\")) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Chiefs ExOff vs Total Yards\",\n    x = \"Expected Off (ExOff)\",\n    y = \"Points Scored (PtS)\",\n    color = \"Taylor Swift Attendance\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA stronger linear relationship is again observable; however, we have chosen not to include this variable in our model, as its underlying significance is unclear.\nLastly, we will observe the relationship between fist down count and Points scored.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nggplot(kcc_g_test, aes(x = FirstD, y = PtS, color = Taylor_Attend)) +\n  geom_point(size = 4, alpha = 0.8) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"red\", \"gold\")) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Chiefs First Down Count vs Total Yards\",\n    x = \"First Down Count (FirstD) \",\n    y = \"Points Scored (PtS)\",\n    color = \"Taylor Swift Attendance\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will continue using Points Scored (PtS) as our response variable."

    "text": "Causal Inference\nIn order to determine If Taylor Swift’s attendance at Chiefs game have a significant effect on points scored, we will perform causal inference. Here we are trying to infer the effect a treatment has on population or otherwise known as Average Treatment Effect (ATE). In our case, the treatment is Taylor Swifts Attendance, and our population is Chiefs games from 2023 to 2024. In order to determine ATE, we will use the following equation.\n\\[\n\\text{ATE} = \\pi_{\\text{treated}} \\cdot \\text{ATT} + \\pi_{\\text{untreated}} \\cdot \\text{ATU}\n\\]\nHere \\(\\pi\\) indicates proportion not 3.14159.\nATT is defined as the average treatment effect has on the treated population. In our case, this refers to the effect Taylor Swift has on games she attended. Here is a mathematical expression of ATT.\n\\[\n\\text{ATT} = \\text{E}[Y_i^1 - Y_i^0 \\, | \\, X_i = 1]\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{ATT} = [Y_{i} - \\text{E}(Y_i^0) \\, | \\, X_i = 1]\n\\]\nHere \\(Y_i^1\\) is the outcome that would occur if treated—that is, the points scored if Taylor attended—and \\(Y_i^0\\) is the outcome that would occur if Taylor did not attend.

    "text": "Insights\nAn Average Treatment Effect (ATE) of 0.175 suggests that Taylor Swift’s presence at Kansas City Chiefs games during the 2023–2024 seasons was associated with a 0.175-point increase in points scored by the team. However, this is not a statistically or practically significant effect. Out of all 41 games played across those two seasons, only one game was decided by a single point.\nThat game represents the only scenario in which her estimated impact might have plausibly influenced the outcome. Even so, it is highly unlikely that her attendance alone would have been enough to change the result.\nA 0.175-point boost amounts to just a 0.77% increase over the Chiefs’ average score during the 2023 and 2024 seasons — a marginal effect. There are many other factors and strategies that could be pursued to increase scoring more effectively and meaningfully.\n\nChief_Losses &lt;- kcc_g_test |&gt; \n  filter(Outcome == \"L\", abs(PtA - PtS) &lt; 2) \n\nChief_Losses |&gt;  dplyr::select(Year, Week, Ppp, PtS, PtA, Outcome, Taylor_Attend)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 7\n   Year Week  Ppp             PtS   PtA Outcome Taylor_Attend\n  &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;        \n1  2023 1     Detroit Lions    20    21 L       no           \n\n\nAn Average Treatment Effect of .175 suggests that Taylor Swifts presence at Kansas City Chiefs games from 2023 to 2024 was responsible for a .175 increase in Points Scored by the Chiefs. This is not a statistically significant effect. In all 41 games of the Chief’s 2023 and 2024 seasons, only game came down to 1 point.\nIn summary, the increase in performance attributed to Taylor Swift’s attendance is neither impactful nor actionable, and is unlikely to have meaningfully affected game outcomes.\n\nLimitations and Future Work\nThis study has several limitations that should be considered, along with opportunities for further research\nFirstly, there is only a small amount of data available to perform inference of Taylor Swifts impact on the Chiefs. While a sufficient amount is used to discover key variables (181 games from 2013 - 2022) in our LASSO model, there is only 41 games available in season 2023 and 2024. We are then forced to train our Causal Models on about half of the remaining data, which leads to inaccurate estimates for our prediction of expected ATE. Assuming their relationship progresses, a more accurate expected ATE will be accessible with around an additional 20 games to train our models on.\nAnother concern arisies in the assumptions we make when determining the expected ATT and ATU. When deriving these values, we are assuming there are no other confounding variables contributing to the difference in predicted and actual points scored other than Taylor Swifts Attendance and some amount of irreducible error. This however is unlikely as there are likely multiple factors that contribute to the success of the Chiefs. Some of these factors may include weather, schedule, timezone, rivalries etc. Most of these factors are unmeasured by the available data set, therefore cannot contribute to t he accuracy of a future model.\nAs stated earlier, our choice of points scored as a response variable indicating the success of the Chief’s offense is flawed. There are multiple factors that contribute to the Chiefs scoring more points that are not associated with the offense, such as opposing defensive strength. It is likely that the chiefs will score more points against teams with a weaker defense. In a future study I would like to explore reponse variables that measure Offensive performance relative to defensive strength. A variable reassuring difference between expected offensive points and actual offensive points would be a stronger response variable.\nAnother issue with using points scored as a response variable is that it include points scored by the entire team. This includes pick sixes, fumble recoveries for touchdowns and safeties, and extra points. thus, points scored also partially measures the success of the defense and special teams. Using another data set that has strictly offensive points scored would solve this problem."
